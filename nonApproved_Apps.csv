CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like youre always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
 
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well.

How it can help you
OCD is a disabling condition that can negatively affect many aspects. Research shows that changing maladaptive (negative) thinking habits can have a positive effect on OCD, as well as anxiety and depression.

3 minutes a day? Are you kidding?
When we started working on the app, we knew that if we want to have a positive impact on peoples mental health, wed better make it easy for them to improve. We designed the 3 minute daily exercise program, and began studying the effect. Fortunately, the results were good. 

Remember: positive change doesnt happen during training. It happens when you utilize supportive thinking in real life.

We designed this app to be fully personalized to you. During onboarding, select your challenges. We will guide you through.

How do I break my negative thinking habits?
1. Get to know what types of thinking patterns are negative
2. Learn to discard negative thoughts that are typical to OCD, anxiety, depression.
3. Discover supportive thoughts that can be used as an alternative inner monologue.
4. Train to embrace supportive thinking to build self-esteem, body appreciation and overcome intrusive thoughts.
5. Utilize the improved self-talk in your daily life.

Is this app similar to psychological therapy?

1. It is being used by OCD CBT psychologists as a complementing tool.
2. It helps in maintaining healthy thinking during or after therapy.
3. It is found to reduce anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. 

The self-talk behind OCD, Anxiety & Depression
According to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, there are various mechanisms that are related to mental health disorders:
- Self criticism (a significant component in depression)

- Constant checking
- Fear of uncertainty
- Fear of regret
- Rumination

The app targets these thinking patterns and helps you overcome them.

As you acquire healthy thinking a habit, this process becomes automatic and easier.

However, you can request a demo on the website of the app: https://mystrength.com/. 

First, there is very little information about the details of the app available on either of the app stores. While most apps at least attempt to give as much descriptive information as possible, this app comes with few details other than stating a few general features e.g. track your mood, join a community, safe and secure. So if anyone is interested in the app the most you have to work with are the pictures, and the website, which is also a little fuzzy on the details.

Second, you cannot download this app unless it has been offered to you by your healthcare provider/benefit plan. You need to sign up on the website with an access code, and there are NO other options available for being able to use this app. So unless it is literally brought to your attention by your health provider, it does not seem as though you can use the app. It is free, but only if you have been given access by your health care provider; you cannot pay for the app yourself it seems.

You can only request to demo the app if you are an organisation willing to collaborate, which is odd. At the very least I would expect such an exclusive app to state so in the very elusive description section.

From the reviews, pictures, and website information it seems as though the app is a good one, however it does not seem to be the best app available. There are a significant number of reviews saying that they do not think all of the content looks as though it is being delivered by professionals, which is concerning given that this is an app essentially endorsed by health care schemes. The website makes grand claims about the outcomes being backed by evidence and studies, but the studies are all featured in journals with low to no impact factor, and there is definitely some graphic deception at play. What looks like an impressive number of studies at first glance on the site, once opened, are not all studies, and the studies did not show up on Google Scholar. My search terms may have been wrong, but at the end of the day it should not be a massive mission to find clinical efficacy of an app if that is a major feature/marketing point.

The privacy policy is thorough, security measures are reported in a nice amount of depth. But there is an interesting potential loop hole I want to point out - under the section where you may delete your data. The privacy policy says you can delete your data, because Your data is yours, however it then goes on to say that while it may be deleted from the primary servers it may not be fully deleted because it may still be around on the back ups of the data. Some may interpret this as transparency, I interpret this as ensuring data can still be kept even if deleted, as people have to accept the privacy policy of any app to use it.","User Generated Data,  Assessments/Screenings,  Gamification (Points/Badges),  Videos,  Audio/Music/Scripts,  Peer Support,  Collaborative With Provider/Other","Free to Download,  Totally Free",For Profit Company,"Surveys,  Diary,  Camera,  Microphone","We all have our struggles.

WHAT IS SOCIAL ANXIETY?

Social anxiety is the fear of being judged by other people. It can make you feel like you aren’t good enough, smart enough, or attractive enough. People who struggle with social anxiety might feel like they’ve got nothing to offer or that they’re just going to be laughed at if they try. Social anxiety exists on a spectrum, and Loop is designed for those with mild to moderate social anxiety. Loop is not a clinical service, assessment, or treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder or any other clinical condition. For mental health support, you should seek help from a licensed mental health professional.

THE SCIENCE BACKED APP
New findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.

STATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)
The basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.
The longer we exercise and make it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.

LEVELS AND TOPICS
The apps many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).

The topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.

You can also test yourself to see how well you progress with our self assessment tool.

iCBT is Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT). CBT is effective and commonly used for a variety of mental health concerns. ‘C’ is for cognitive and refers to what and how we think. ‘B’ is for behavioral or how we act.

Those thoughts, emotions, and behaviours connect to our moods, our physical experiences, and events in our lives.

Backed by a decade of NIH-supported clinical research, this mobile game rewires subconscious habits of thinking to reduce stress and anxiety.* It just takes a few minutes a day, 4 days a week! Based on your current stress levels, a daily goal of gameplay is recommended (typically between 6-10 minutes). Then, you can choose from a number of different game regions and start playing to meet your daily goal. It’s that simple!
In addition to gameplay, you can also access brief, science-backed tools to support your mental health journey including:
-Journaling & mood tracking to help identify feelings and triggers
-Breathing exercises to calm anxiety and improve sleep
-Mindfulness practices to regulate emotions and reduce stress

*Safety and efficacy claims have not been evaluated by the FDA. Personal Zen is available via the Enforcement Discretion Policy introduced by the FDA in April 2020, allowing computerized behavioral therapies for anxiety disorders to be commercially distributed without a 510(k) premarket notification and a prescription.


HOW DO I USE PERSONAL ZEN?
Start by completing a daily check-in and tune into your stress and mood. The check-in helps determine your personalized goal for game play. To use Personal Zen, look for the sparkle to follow the friendly sprite (the smiling face) after it disappears. Dont try to capture the friendly sprite. Simply tap on the sparkle quickly, then smoothly trace the path left in its wake. A “medallion” will appear, telling you where to focus your attention next. Don’t let the angry sprite divert your focus from finding the sparkle. It’s natural to sometimes trace the path a couple of times to achieve accuracy. Play until reaching your goal for the day.

Do a mood check-in or visit the Positive Practices area to take a few minutes to review tips and tools for reducing stress and anxiety from Dr. Tracy, creator of Personal Zen. Personal Zen offers science-based tools, like breathing exercises, musical therapy, and journaling, among other tips that help better manage stress and anxiety.

HOW DOES PERSONAL ZEN WORK?
During gameplay, angry and happy sprites briefly appear then disappear. You are then prompted to trace the trail left by the happy sprite. During gameplay, you might notice that your attention draws to the angry sprite instead of the happy sprite. This is called ‘threat bias’ - a subconscious habit of attention that drives you to focus on negative information at the expense of the positive. Threat bias acts like an information filter that distorts your ability to cope with anxiety, sparking vicious cycles of distress and worry. By playing the game, we change this habit and shift your threat bias to focus more on the positive, rather than the negative. Personal Zen helps to short-circuit these negative habits of attention and allows the user to develop a more flexible and positive focus.

Brief training with Personal Zen can even reduce your body’s stress response! Our studies show that using the app 6-10 minutes a day, 4 days a week reduces levels of stress hormones known as cortisol, and reduces anxiety.

HERE’S WHAT EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY HAD TO SAY ABOUT PERSONAL ZEN:

“Personal Zen brings cutting-edge research and well-established strategies for reducing anxiety and stress into the palm of your hand.”
Dr. Shannon M. Bennett, Assistant Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College


“Instantly engaging for adults and kids, Personal Zen is a rare example of science turned into fun in order to reduce stress and anxiety.”
Dr. Tony Simon, Professor of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California Davis


We respect your privacy. Read our privacy policy and terms of use here:
https://personalzen.com/legal/",Personal Zen,10000,"Personal Zen is a game-based digital therapeutic intended to treat patients 13 years of age and older with mild to severe levels of clinically elevated anxiety or distress and is intended to be used in consultation with your healthcare provider. 

Personal Zen’s core therapeutic mechanism of action is a game-based approach to a decades old area of neurocognitive research known as Attention Bias Modification (ABM). Through this proprietary approach to ABM, Personal Zen uses gamification to target neural pathways associated with emotional and attentional patterns that can drive excessive anxiety and distress.

Based on your current levels of anxiety, fatigue and pain, a daily goal of gameplay is recommended (typically between 6 and 12 minutes). Play 4 times a week for at least 4 weeks to see the best results. 
You can also access brief, science-backed tools to support your mental health journey including:
- Journaling & mood tracking to help identify feelings and triggers
- Breathing exercises to calm anxiety and improve sleep
- Mindfulness practices

How Does Personal Zen Work?
The human brain is uniquely predisposed to unconscious, sub-second processing of facial expression. Personal Zen uses facial archetypes and gamification to re-train emotional and attentional patterns that can drive persistent feelings of anxiety and distress. Personal Zen’s proprietary game mechanics have been designed and optimized through a decade of neuroscientific research using EEG, neurostimulation, eye tracking, heart rate monitoring and MRI.

Personal Zen has been clinically validated through six randomized controlled clinical trials published in leading peer-reviewed research journals including Clinical Psychological Science, Behavior Research & Therapy, and Biological Psychology. 

After 4 weeks of usage, clinical effects have included a 38% reduction in anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), a 491% reduction in cognitive signs of anxiety (Dot-Probe Task Measure), as well as a statistically significant reduction in the stress hormone cortisol.

How Do I Play Personal Zen?
Start by logging your levels of Anxiety, Fatigue, and Pain. A daily goal of gameplay will be recommended between 6 and 12 minutes. It is recommended that you meet this daily goal 4 days a week for at least 4 weeks. To play Personal Zen, swipe the path left by the friendly sprite (smiling face) after it disappears. A “medallion” will appear, telling you where to focus your attention next. Don’t let the angry sprite divert your focus. Unlock new regions by earning points and increasing your level.

The app developers have included a screening and a warning to those who do not only experience GAD, social anxiety and depression that the app may not be suitable.

• SIMPLE TREATMENT REMEDIES YOU CAN DO YOURSELF
All of the Mental Health Recovery Guide’s advice is simple, and even fun. For example, how can dancing help with depression, or other forms of mental illness? How much water should you drink to improve your mental health? These and other questions are answered within our alternative guide to healing and self-betterment.

### “It felt like the game reset or was able to clean up my mind” Patient, Antwerp, Belgium ###

### How does it work? ###
MyCognition PRO improves your cognition by monitoring and strengthening your cognitive fitness using the clinically validated MyCQ assessment and AquaSnap training game. 

MyCQ monitors your cognition producing detailed reports. It assesses the key five cognitive domains; Executive Function, Attention, Episodic Memory, Processing Speed and Working Memory. These control the way you think and behave through your ability to plan, solve problems, recall, concentrate, and act with speed and accuracy.

MyCQ then personalises the training app, AquaSnap, to ensure training is focused more intensely where most needed. As part of your cognitive fitness journey, the Healthy Habit programme is added to improve your lifestyle around Sleep, Hydration, Nutrition, Exercise and Social Relationships. 

### “Our employee health initiative runs multiple events every year, but the response to use MyCognition has been the biggest we’ve ever had. It clearly shows how interested our employees are in their brain health.” -- Michael Cole-Fontayn, EVP and Chairman EMEA Bank of New York ###
