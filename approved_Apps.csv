""This app has made me calmer and more focused. I am loving the advantages of my meditation and having the shorter meditations has been invaluable when time has been short. I cannot recommend this calming and informative meditation app enough.""
- Lizzie Gowland

“I started using minding during the most stressful period of my life - preparing for my state exams. Before I started, I was experiencing constant worry, pain, stress and even depression. Meditating for 20 minutes a day with minding radically changed the way my days and eventually my life felt. Monty, thank you for your help, your meditations really saved my life.”
- Teresa Hergueta

“Im so happy to have found minding. The app has proved to be a friendly and useful guide and provided me with all the tools I need to develop my practice. Throughout the course, each meditation is delivered in a soothing, melodic tone which supports the development of the key principles of mindfulness; I recommend minding to people I work with who are looking to achieve the benefits of mindfulness. To date, those documented include improved sleep, increased ability to regulate emotions and enhanced wellbeing, I would highly recommend this app to anyone interested in achieving these outcomes"".

The module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.

It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.

Another feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)

The module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).

The SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.

In the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.

In the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.

★ Exercise and fitness activities
★ Affirmations and coping statements
★ Behavioural activation
★ Yoga

MoodMission is based in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which is an evidence-based psychological therapy for anxiety and depression. Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.

A randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).

Completing Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.

Rootd is anxiety and panic attack relief in your pocket.",Rootd - Anxiety & Panic Relief,500000,"** App of the Day ** — Apple

Rootd is the award-winning, scientifically validated, female led app for anxiety & panic attacks. As seen in Womens Health, Time Magazine, Healthline and more. 

“I’ve suffered from panic attacks for almost 10 years. I’ve done CBT, medication, meditation, but nothing helped me in the moment when that panic attack hit, until I downloaded Rootd. Rootd makes it feel like someone is with me, even when I’m alone. I owe my continued stability to this simple genius app. Its a MUST for all who are facing the same type of war.” RainyNally

Understand, and overcome anxiety & panic attacks with Rootd’s therapist-approved panic button, guided deep breathing, anxiety journal, soothing visualizations, stats page, emergency contact, and lessons. 

We set out to build Rootd after suffering from panic attacks and anxiety for several years. The only help we could find was either too expensive, ineffective, or poorly designed. Our mission is to help others find accessible relief from their panic and anxiety, and to end the stigma against those affected. 

Finally, an app for conquering panic attacks and anxiety that blends a guided process for both immediate and long term relief, with clean and engaging design.

Everyone has heroic potential.

Join over 1 million people who have played SuperBetter to improve their resilience, mental health and social emotional learning.

SuperBetter builds resilience – the ability to stay strong, motivated and optimistic even in the face of life’s challenges. Playing SuperBetter unlocks heroic potential to overcome tough situations and achieve goals that matter most.

SuperBetter was invented by world-renowned game designer Jane McGonigal. Its unique methodology uses the psychology of game play to build life skills, overcome obstacles & achieve greater success in all areas of life.

We make the SuperBetter web & mobile apps available for free to anyone around the world.

►► Message from the SuperBetter team

We’re a small but mighty team working to amplify the impact of SuperBetter in the world. Our reality means prioritizing resources on an upcoming version of SuperBetter that will dramatically grow our impact. We do our best to maintain the Original SuperBetter as a free service, but the apps can sometimes be buggy. If you have issues on your device, try the website.

►► Exciting News from Davos

Based on a sneak peak of our upcoming plans, SuperBetter was named a winner of The World Economic Forum’s Youth Mental Health Challenge. In the future SuperBetter will be available for players of all ages, and we are excited to play a bigger role to help end the mental health crisis among youth & young adults.

►► Why play SuperBetter?

Here are some reasons people use SuperBetter:

- To adopt a new habit, learn or improve a skill, strengthen a relationship, make a physical or athletic breakthrough, complete a meaningful project, or pursue a lifelong dream.
- To beat depression, overcome anxiety, manage stress, cope with chronic pain, or heal from a concussion or other physical injury,
- To overcome a life challenge like dealing with a school setback, finding a new job, surviving divorce, or grieving a loss.
- To help others – teachers use the SuperBetter methodology to promote social-emotional learning, therapists refer the SuperBetter app to their patients.

►► What is the Power of Living Gamefully?

To Live Gamefully means bringing the same mindset and psychological strengths naturally displayed when playing games – such as optimism, creativity, courage, and determination – to real life. It means having the courage and openness to try different strategies to discover what works best. It means collaborating with allies, and building up the resilience to tackle tougher and tougher challenges with greater and greater success.

►► SuperBetter is backed by science

SuperBetter is validated in published studies to build resilience, improve mental health, and support recovery.

We have worked with closely autistic people at every stage in developing Molehill Mountain to ensure that it is easy for autistic people to use and is relevant to their needs.

Molehill Mountain is based on Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), a well-established and clinically proven technique for managing the symptoms of anxiety. The app has been developed with the full involvement of Professor Emily Simonoff, Dr Ann Ozsivadjian and Dr Rachel Kent from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London.

Most autistic people experience anxiety on a regular basis. Around eight out of ten will have symptoms of anxiety – and of these, three or four will have enough symptoms to be given a diagnosis of anxiety disorder.

Molehill Mountain allows you to track your worries and identify the situations that trigger your anxiety. Your daily check-ins are plotted on a chart which allows you to identify pattern and trends – and you can also display a previous check-in to help you identify recurring triggers for your anxiety.

Over time, you unlock tips that will help you to understand your anxiety and learn ways to manage it. The daily tips have been completely rewritten for this new version of Molehill Mountain. In addition, we have added dozens of extra mini-tips to cover many of the common causes of anxiety and stress in autistic people, such as hypersensitivity to noise, light and touch or difficulties with social situations and communication.

The app also has interactive CBT activities which you can use at any time. These draw upon well-established and clinically proven techniques and are designed to help you to recognise and overcome unhelpful patterns of thinking. 

The development of Molehill Mountain has been supported by:
    •  The Maudsley Charity
    •  The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists’ Charity
    •  The Pixel Fund

The information in the app is largely accurate and evidence-based. In various locations, the app clearly states that it is not intended as a replacement for therapy and/or medication; instead, the app clearly defines its role as an adjunct to treatment. 

The free version of the app includes almost all features, although a ""Pro"" version is required in order to export the users data; therefore, the free version does not give the user full ownership of data. The app description claims that the company is non-profit, although no further details are given and there is no claim of IRS 501(c)(3) status. There are several affiliate links embedded within the app that would give the app developer commission if the user chooses to purchase any of the services, such as connecting to a therapist; however, the affiliate links appear to be clearly labeled.

The apps Privacy Policy is hosted on Medium.com, an unusual choice given that Medium offers a limited number of free article views per month. The policy states that written personal information remains on the device. The app does collect ""anonymous aggregate"" information, and there are no guarantees regarding the security of data nor details about practices beyond ""striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting Personal Information"". Moreover, there are many links to other websites and videos embedded within the app, and the user should be aware that the apps Privacy Policy does not extend to this ""external"" content that is often viewed within the app itself. The user should also be aware that there are some differences between the policies for the Android and iOS versions of the app. Nonetheless, by keeping most personal data on the device, this app offers more privacy than other similar apps in the marketplace.

Overall, this app offers information largely in agreement with evidence-based medicine; notably, users are encouraged to seek mental health treatment as an adjunct to the app. Although this app does not offer any particularly unique features, it does compile several common features into a single app, which some users may find appealing.","User Generated Data,  Assessments/Screenings,  Videos,  Audio/Music/Scripts","Free to Download,  In-App Purchase,  Subscription",Non-Profit Company,"Surveys,  Diary","If you are feeling sad, anxious, or depressed, lift your mood with MoodTools!

Description

If you experience symptoms of depression and anxiety like sadness, low self-esteem, brooding, fatigue or sleep problems, this is not uncommon. Ups and downs are a normal part of human psychology! But if you feel that these complaints last longer than a couple of days and they become a burden, you might want to check up on your mental health. MindDoc is a depression app that helps you track, monitor, and understand your complaints in a structured manner and, perhaps, find out which negative behavior could be connected with a worse well-being. At the end of the program, you will receive a detailed summary that you can also share with healthcare professionals, e.g. therapists, psychiatrists, or general physicians. During the screening period, you will find helpful information on psychology, signs of depression, therapy and mental health.


About MindDoc

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) treatment is a type of psychotherapy — or talk therapy — that utilizes a cognitive-behavioral approach. It began with efforts to treat borderline personality disorder (also known as Emotional Instability Disorder). DBT has been conceptualized as a treatment that is broadly applicable for individuals who have difficulties regulating emotion. Empirical evidence now supports the use of DBT adapted for eating disorders, substance use disorders, and PTSD.

Whether you get caught up in cycles of stress and anxiety, regularly give yourself a hard time or struggle to relax and enjoy the moment – this app can help.

The app includes scientifically-validated practices from Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT), with 50+ tools to help you when life gets hard. Be guided by Drs Chris Irons and Elaine Beaumont – leading authorities on self-compassion, who collectively have 40+ years of experience as therapists and have helped tens of thousands of people.

This app has undergone a nationwide study, with participants showing significant reductions in stress, anxiety, self criticism, and increases in wellbeing. Anyone can develop self-compassion and enjoy all its benefits – we look forward to showing you how.

Why self-compassion?
We are often our own harshest critic, talking to ourselves in ways that we would never do our close friends. Given that we spend more time with ourselves than anyone else, isn’t it strange that many of us don’t treat ourselves with the same level of kindness, care and support as we do our close friends? Now is your time to start.

With evidence based ideas and exercises from CFT, this app will teach you how to cultivate compassion for yourself and others. Through the course, you’ll learn how to strike a balance between self improvement & self acceptance: teaching you how to have a realistic but kind view of difficulties that arise in life, and giving you the confidence you need to achieve your goals in life, work and relationships.
A toolkit for managing the ups and downs of life.

Reduce anxiety, stress & depression
Improve mood & wellbeing
Reduce feelings of shame & low self-esteem
Better understand yourself
Increase your confidence
Improve your productivity
Appreciate the good in every day
Develop your relationships
Feel calm & grounded
Be kinder to yourself
And more...

There’s something for everyone:
Visual breathing tools to bring you back to the present
Sleep stories & meditations
HIIT and yoga videos to get you moving
Mindfulness audio guides
Cutting-edge tools to measure & improve your heart rate variability
Journaling to create habits of positivity

Why self-compassion?

We are often our own harshest critic, talking to ourselves in ways that we would never do our close friends.

With evidence based ideas and exercises from CFT, this app will teach you how to cultivate compassion for yourself and others. Through the course, you’ll learn how to strike a balance between self improvement & self acceptance: teaching you how to have a realistic but kind view of difficulties that arise in life, and giving you the confidence you need to achieve your goals in life, work and relationships.

Want to learn how to become more successful and enjoy the power of inner-monologue?

IMPROVING SELF LOVE AND SELF ESTEEM IS SIMPLE
Throw away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your self esteem and wellness.

SCIENCE BACKED
The app is shown to improve supportive thinking and reduce maladaptive beliefs in 7 published academic papers.
According to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, and maladaptive behaviours.

HOW DO I FEEL SELF LOVE
The foundations of healthy self worth and self esteem are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that ""everything in my life needs to be prefect"", I wont be able to live up to these expectations and my confidence will decrease.

BELIEFS AND SELF TALK
Beliefs and self talk are interrelated. With daily affirmations, we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk. We can change our beliefs and get rid of thinking patterns that negatively affect our confidence and self-esteem.

HOW THE APP WORKS
The app is designed to:
1. Increase your awareness of negative thoughts
2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts
3. Increase your daily access to affirmations and supportive thoughts
4. Increase the automaticity of helpful thinking
5. Provide daily affirmations for confidence and self-esteem boost

IS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?
Our app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:
1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.
2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.
3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. 

GET TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS
The basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.
The more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.
 
HOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?
To feel better and improve your confidence, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.

BEGIN YOUR JOURNEY TO SELF LOVE
The apps many topics and themes are broken down into more than 500 levels. Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts. Users are required to complete a random set of thoughts to complete the level.
To further strengthen learning of supportive self-talk, each level the player completes is followed by a memory game in which one has to identify a supportive statements that appeared in the previous level.

The topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty, fear of abandonment, and more.

You can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.

Training using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle maintaining low self-esteem.

HOW CAN IMPROVING SELF-LOVE BE SO SIMPLE?
We tend to overcomplicate things. Research shows our mind can learn and adapt by using the power of helpful thinking. There are multiple published studies that show this app to be effective for body image, obsessions, self esteem and even depression!

Whats the story behind the app?
The app is the result of collaboration between a game developer and a clinical psychologist. When we created this app, we wanted it to be as effective as possible, and to take only 3 minutes a day to complete and improve. So when we published the first version, Prof. Guy Doron began researching the impact of the daily training. We found that within 14 days, users managed to build mental resilience that lasted for additional 30 days!

IMPROVING CONFIDENCE IS SIMPLE
Throw away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your self esteem and wellness.

SCIENCE BACKED
New findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.
According to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, and maladaptive behaviours. 

HOW DO I BUILD MY SELF-ESTEEM?
The foundations of healthy confidence and self esteem are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that ""everything in myself needs to be prefect"", I wont be able to live up to these expectations and my confidence will decrease.

BELIEFS AND SELF TALK
Beliefs and self talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk, it can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our confidence and self esteem.

1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.
2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.
3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. 

HELPFUL THINKING
The basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes unhelpful self talk - throw it away by swiping it up. If the thought promotes positive or helpful thinking, accept it by swiping it down.

The more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.
 
HOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?
